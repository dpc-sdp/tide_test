# Tide Test
Test content type for [Tide](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/tide) distribution for [Drupal 10](https://github.com/dpc-sdp)

This module is used for independent testing of configuration added by modules to all content types. Do not install this module on its own; the modules having Behat tests based on "Test" content type should define `tide_test` as a dependency.

Tide is a Drupal 10 distribution focused on delivering an API first, headless Drupal content administration site.
